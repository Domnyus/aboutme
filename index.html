            <h2>Personal 🧐</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Jonas Santos Menezes, or Domnyus, or Domn, or whatever you'd like to call.</p>
            <p>I've started when I was 13 in c++, bus, honestly I didn't know what I was doing and I remember nothing of
                it.</p>
            <p>Throught my adolescence I tried to make some text-based games, but no success and I forgot about coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                On high school one of my classmates said that the State Institute CEET Vasco Coutinho semester will
                start and I could
                try to take a technical course, an IT course. I said to my mother and she agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                On my first day I felt in love by programming, coding and soon for development itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon I decided to work with it. I started a graduation on Computer Science with a nacional scholarship,
                and I was, in my opinion, great!
            </p>
            <p>
                But the Pandemia started, i had to attend to online classes and my grades was like gold to trash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Failed in do the homeworks because I hadn't a computer, failed to study and I lost my scholarship.
            </p>
            <p>
                My life was a giant mess, I got depression and sincerly I didn't even want to live. But I overcame, or
                I'm really close to! I didn't give up!
            </p>
            <p>
                And now my familly could afford a PC for me and I am study as much as I can and I still dreaming!
            </p>
